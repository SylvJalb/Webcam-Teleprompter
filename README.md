# Webcam Teleprompter

I use a Logitech C920, but it is compatible with other webcams.

You will need to buy a glass plate measuring 20cm by 20cm, with a thickness of 2mm. I personally added a one-way film to test, but this is not obligatory.

If necessary, adjust the 3D model of the screen clip. This one is suitable for my screen.

I print with a Creality K1, in PLA, with 30% infill.

I will complete the README and put some photos when the printing and testing are finished.
